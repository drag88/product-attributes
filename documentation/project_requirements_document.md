# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is about building a unified framework that streamlines the generation and management of attributes for various e-commerce fashion products such as Sarees, Kurtas, and Saree Blouses. The framework will consolidate the current attribute pipelines – keeping their validation logic and processing intact – while offering the flexibility to add new product types (like shirts or trousers) and new attributes as trends evolve. It is designed to make managing and validating product attributes simpler and more consistent for developers and product managers.

The framework is being built to reduce the complexity of updating multiple pipelines whenever new products or trends emerge, ensuring that both common attributes (shared across products) and unique product-specific attributes are handled properly. Key objectives for this project include maintaining existing functionality, enabling easy configuration through JSON/YAML files, ensuring efficient processing with Apache Airflow, and providing robust logging and monitoring. Success will come when the system can support multiple product lines with minimal manual intervention and offer automated, scalable attribute generation.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Development of a unified attribute generation framework for e-commerce fashion products.
*   Consolidation of existing attribute pipelines with current validations and Pydantic models.
*   Integration of configuration file (JSON/YAML) based input to add or update product types and attributes.
*   Intelligent differentiation between common attributes and product-specific attributes.
*   Workflow orchestration using Apache Airflow for tasks like extraction, processing, and validations.
*   API and CLI interfaces for automated integration and manual configuration or monitoring.
*   Inclusion of robust logging and monitoring using Python’s logging module and basic monitoring with Airflow.
*   Support for asynchronous processing, error handling, retries, and quarantine mechanisms for persistent errors.
*   Preparation for future AI/machine learning integration (though not implemented in Phase 1).

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Developing a dedicated admin UI for configuration management; the framework will rely on configuration files.
*   Implementation of role-based access controls or user authentication since it is not a requirement.
*   Extensive integration with external logging/monitoring tools such as Prometheus or Grafana beyond basic setup.
*   Direct integration of advanced machine learning predictions and suggestions for attribute generation at this stage.
*   Cloud-based deployment – initial deployment is to be done on a local machine only.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user begins by connecting to the framework via an API for automated integration or by accessing the CLI for manual configuration. The first step is to load a pre-defined JSON or YAML configuration file that details the product types (e.g., Sarees, Kurtas, Saree Blouses) and the expected attributes. This ensures that the system has the necessary guidelines, including enum definitions and validation rules, before starting the attribute generation process.

Once the configuration is loaded and possibly updated for current business needs, the user initiates the main workflow orchestrated by Apache Airflow. The processing begins with data extraction and validation using Pydantic models and custom validators—handling unique and common attributes accordingly. Throughout the process, the user can monitor progress through the Airflow UI and review detailed logs, and if errors occur, built-in retry logic and error quarantine steps ensure the system remains robust. Once processing is completed, results can be inspected and used, making it an efficient cycle from configuration to execution and monitoring.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Unified Attribute Aggregation:**\
    Merges disparate attribute pipelines into one cohesive system that handles both existing and new e-commerce products.
*   **Extensible Configuration:**\
    Uses editable configuration files (JSON/YAML) to allow the easy addition or modification of product types and attributes without needing code changes for standard operations.
*   **Intelligent Differentiation:**\
    Automatically distinguishes common attributes (shared across multiple products) from unique, product-specific attributes to maintain both uniformity and specialization.
*   **Advanced Validation Logic:**\
    Leverages Pydantic models, custom validators, and enum-based fuzzy matching to ensure product attributes are correctly validated and corrected if needed.
*   **Workflow Orchestration with Apache Airflow:**\
    Utilizes a task-based setup to coordinate steps like data extraction, processing, validation, error handling, and retries in a streamlined manner.
*   **Robust Logging and Monitoring:**\
    Captures detailed logs using Python’s logging module in a structured JSON format and monitors process progress and errors via the Airflow UI.
*   **Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms:**\
    Implements automatic task-level retries (with exponential backoff and optional tenacity integration for API calls) and quarantines persistent errors for manual review.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:**\
    Supports asynchronous and parallel processing capabilities to efficiently handle large volumes of products and attributes with dynamic batching.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend/Interface:**

    *   No graphical user interface is planned; interactions are provided via an API and a CLI, making the system lightweight and scriptable.

*   **Backend & Data Processing:**

    *   Python as the primary programming language.
    *   Apache Airflow for workflow management and task orchestration.
    *   Pydantic for validation models and data integrity checks.
    *   Enum modules and custom validators for attribute checks and fuzzy matching.
    *   Redis for caching attribute lookups (e.g., for more efficient fuzzy matching).

*   **Storage:**

    *   MongoDB for scalable, flexible storage of product information and attributes.
    *   Option for cloud-based migration in the future (e.g., S3/Parquet) for large-scale processing.

*   **Additional Tools & Integrations:**

    *   Cursor: To leverage advanced IDE features with real-time code suggestions.
    *   Claude AI from Anthropic (potential future use for intelligent code assistance and advanced attribute predictions).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**\
    Each product should be processed in less than 30 seconds, with a throughput target of processing 10K products in under 2 hours. The system should handle up to 50K+ products in future phases with minimal architectural changes.
*   **Scalability:**\
    The framework must support dynamic batching and asynchronous processing, adjusting to varying data loads and CPU/RAM metrics.
*   **Security & Compliance:**\
    While user authentication is not required now, the system should ensure that all data exchanges and validations are secure and maintain data integrity. Future deployments must account for basic security practices especially around API endpoints.
*   **Usability:**\
    The system should be self-explanatory via its API and CLI with clear logging and error reporting. Errors should be handled gracefully and informative logs should be provided.
*   **Reliability:**\
    Built-in retries and error handling (e.g., exponential backoff) ensure that transient errors do not cause a complete system failure, maintaining a failure rate below 1%.
*   **Response Times:**\
    API response and overall processing should align with the performance metrics outlined – ensuring both high throughput and low latency per operation.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Platform Constraint:**\
    The initial deployment is assumed to run on a local machine. No cloud-based deployment is planned for phase one.
*   **Technology Dependency:**\
    The project relies on the availability of Python, Apache Airflow, and MongoDB. Future integration with Redis and advanced AI models like Claude is assumed to be possible without major refactoring.
*   **Configuration-Driven Customization:**\
    It is assumed that most product type and attribute modifications will be handled via configuration files. Only complex validations or attribute relationships will require minor code changes.
*   **Error Handling:**\
    Tasks in Apache Airflow handle retries using built-in parameters and possibly the tenacity library for API calls. It is assumed that these mechanisms will be sufficient for handling transient failures and ensuring idempotency.
*   **Performance Assumptions:**\
    The framework expects to handle an initial load of 5K–10K products with 20–30 attributes each and scale gradually to 50K+ products. Hardware assumptions (e.g., t3.large instance for initial processing) are based on current performance targets.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits:**\
    When integrating with external APIs (such as Anthropic’s API for future enhancements), anticipate rate limits (e.g., 1K requests/minute). Use concurrent rate limiters and batch processing to mitigate this risk.
*   **Error Propagation in Workflows:**\
    Despite built-in retries, persistent errors might need manual intervention. Set up clear logging and quarantine mechanisms to route persistent errors without halting the entire process.
*   **Configuration File Errors:**\
    Mistakes in JSON/YAML configuration files could disrupt processing. Implement robust parsing and error reporting to catch configuration issues early before they affect the pipeline.
*   **Data Volume Growth:**\
    As product data and attribute entries grow, performance bottlenecks could appear. Prepare to use caching (e.g., Redis) and optimize batch sizes dynamically based on real-time metrics to counteract this.
*   **Asynchronous Consistency:**\
    Parallel processing might introduce race conditions or data inconsistencies. Ensure that validations and updates are idempotent, and that each product is uniquely identified during processing.
*   **Integration Testing:**\
    With many moving parts (Airflow tasks, API calls, configuration files, and validation logic), integration tests must be thorough to catch any edge cases or data mismatches early on.

This PRD provides a detailed blueprint for developing a unified attribute generation framework for e-commerce fashion products. It covers the project scope, user flow, core features, technical stack, and non-functional requirements while remaining open enough to allow enhancements in future phases.
