# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This project is a unified framework that streamlines the generation and management of product attributes for various e-commerce fashion items such as Sarees, Kurtas, and Saree Blouses. The primary goal is to bring together existing attribute pipelines under one roof while keeping all current validations intact and ensuring the flexibility to add new product types and attributes as trends shift. By using a configuration-driven approach, users can update product specifications without extensive code changes, enabling a smooth experience whether you are a developer integrating the API or a product manager using the CLI.

## Frontend Technologies

Since the framework does not have a traditional graphical user interface, the interaction points are provided through an API and a command-line interface (CLI). This design makes it lightweight and straightforward. The API allows developers to automate attribute generation and integrate the framework into existing systems, while the CLI offers a hands-on method for manual configuration and monitoring. The simplicity here ensures that users can focus on setting up configurations and initiating workflows without the distractions of a complex front-end design.

## Backend Technologies

The backbone of this system is built on Python, which offers both clarity and versatility. Apache Airflow is used to orchestrate the entire workflow, managing tasks such as data extraction, validation, and processing in a sequence that ensures reliability and scalability. MongoDB is selected for storage due to its ability to handle flexible and scalable schema design, which is ideal when frequent updates or changes are required. Additionally, Pydantic models and custom validators (including fuzzy matching with enums) ensure that the attributes of each product are correctly validated and formatted. To enhance performance, Redis is incorporated as a caching layer, particularly for quick lookups during attribute matching. These backend choices work together to maintain data consistency and allow the framework to adapt quickly to evolving product details.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

For now, the deployment environment is set to run on a local machine. This setup is chosen to keep the initial development simple and controlled. Version control is an integral part of the process, ensuring that changes can be tracked and managed effectively. The decision to use Apache Airflow as the workflow management tool means that deployment is designed for scalability: tasks are managed, retried, and monitored automatically, which ensures that even as the size of the product data grows, the system will remain robust and responsive. Although cloud deployments are considered for future scaling, the current focus is on local execution, keeping the infrastructure straightforward and reliable.

## Third-Party Integrations

The framework benefits from several third-party integrations that enhance its functionality. Apache Airflow is key for orchestrating and automating the processing workflows. In addition, the framework leverages advanced coding tools like Cursor, an IDE that offers AI-powered suggestions to improve development speed. There is also planned integration with Claude AI – Anthropic's Sonnet 3.5 model – for potential future enhancements in code assistance and intelligent attribute predictions. These tools complement the core tech stack by providing robust workflow management and smart coding support, ultimately contributing to a smooth user experience and streamlined operations.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security in this project has been designed to be straightforward, as user authentication and role-based access controls are not required at this stage. Instead, the focus is on data validation and robust error handling, achieved through the use of Pydantic models and Apache Airflow’s built-in retry mechanisms. The system ensures that each task is idempotent, meaning that retries do not produce duplicates or inconsistent results. To improve performance, considerations such as client-side caching with Redis and parallel processing through Airflow have been implemented. Detailed logging with Python’s logging module is used to capture all essential events, while monitoring through Airflow’s user interface keeps the process transparent and manageable.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, this framework is built using Python and Apache Airflow for its reliable and scalable workflow management, MongoDB for flexible storage, and robust data validation through Pydantic and custom validators with enums. The lightweight interface provided via API and CLI makes the system both easy to integrate and manage. The incorporation of Redis as a caching tool and the potential for future enhancements using Claude AI sets this project apart by focusing both on current efficiency and future adaptability. Every component, from local deployment to third-party integrations, is chosen to ensure that the attribute generation process remains resilient, flexible, and prepared for future expansion in the dynamic world of e-commerce fashion products.
