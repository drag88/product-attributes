# Unified E-Commerce Fashion Attribute Generation Framework: App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is a unified framework that streamlines the generation and management of attributes for various e-commerce fashion products. It is designed to consolidate existing processing pipelines while providing flexibility to integrate new product types and attributes as trends evolve. Developers and product managers can use this framework to maintain current validation logic and processing functionalities, while easily adapting configurations to include emerging products such as shirts or trousers. The core goal is to achieve consistency in managing both shared and unique attributes across different fashion items like Sarees, Kurtas, and Saree Blouses.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a developer or product manager first accesses the framework, they do so by launching the interface via an API for automated integration or through the command-line interface for manual operations. There is no traditional sign-in or sign-up process involved because the system is designed for seamless integration on a local machine without user authentication. On initial access, the user is prompted to load a pre-defined configuration file, available in JSON or YAML format. This file contains all necessary information such as product types, attribute details, and validation rules. The onboarding process ensures that the system has the required guidelines before any processing begins.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After the initial configuration is loaded, the framework provides a central point of interaction. Although there is no graphical homepage, the command-line interface or API response serves as the main dashboard. This central view displays status messages, progress updates, and options for the next steps. The interface clearly outlines sections that involve configuration review, initiation of the attribute generation pipeline, and access to logs and monitoring information. Users can easily navigate to start the workflow process, check for processing reports, or read detailed log information from the integrated Apache Airflow UI.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The first major feature flow begins with configuring product types and attributes. Once the configuration file is loaded, users verify and update the parameters as needed. The system leverages this file as the single source of truth, ensuring that existing validations and enum-based safeguards are maintained. The next step involves initiating the attribute generation workflow, which is orchestrated by Apache Airflow. During this stage, the framework extracts data, processes it according to the Pydantic models and custom validators, and handles both common and product-specific attributes in a synchronized manner. Users experience smooth transitions as the system moves from reading configuration files to launching parallel modular tasks. In addition, the monitoring interface, visible in both the CLI and through Airflowâ€™s dashboard, provides real-time updates on task retries, error handling, and successful completions. If needed, users can manually intervene via the CLI by inspecting logs or modifying the configuration file to adjust processing parameters before restarting the workflow.

## Settings and Account Management

Even though there are no traditional account management pages, users have full control over the system settings through direct configuration file edits. By updating these files, they can manage attributes, modify validation logic, and set specific parameters for airflow tasks such as retry limits and backoff timings. The settings also include performance tuning options like batch resizing and logging preferences. After making any changes, the user simply re-launches the process either via the API or CLI, and the framework reloads the updated configurations with no interruption to the overall system flow. This approach simplifies the management of the application and ensures all updates are applied consistently across all modules.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

During the attribute generation process, if a user inputs invalid data or if the system encounters connectivity issues, built-in error handling protocols immediately take effect. The workflow is designed to automatically retry failed tasks with exponential backoff. Persistent issues are flagged and moved into a quarantine mode, where users are alerted through detailed log entries visible on the Airflow UI and within the console output. In these instances, the system provides clear, human-readable error messages that explain the nature of the failure and suggest manual review steps. This mechanism ensures that temporary problems or unexpected errors do not derail the overall workflow and that users can resume normal operation as soon as the issue is resolved.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From start to finish, the user journey in this framework is seamless and efficient. Developers and product managers begin by loading a configuration file that sets all product types and attribute rules. They then initiate the processing workflow via an API call or through a CLI interface, where robust validation and automated error handling ensure that each product is processed accurately. The integrated monitoring and logging features provide real-time feedback on the status and outcomes of each task, while easy-to-edit settings allow ongoing adjustments directly from the configuration file. The design of the framework is both scalable and adaptable, ensuring that as business needs evolve, the system continues to deliver consistent results with minimal manual intervention.
